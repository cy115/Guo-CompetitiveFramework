// Rearrange order to your preference for each Special Infected class.
// You can set any number of "order" values, all are not required to be entered.
// When no order value is matched, the Special Infected will default to using the games internal targeting logic.
//
// Order:		Prioritize who to attack first:
//				1	= Normal Survivor.基本生还
//				2	= Vomited Survivor.被胆汁生还
//				3	= Incapacitated Survivor.倒地

//				5	= Ledge hanging Survivor.挂壁
//				6	= Vomited Special Infected (Tanks will not attack other Special Infected).胆汁特感
//				7	= Last Attacker. Only from bullets/melee weapons. Set after most/all other order priorities since there will always be a last attacker.最后攻击的
//				8	= Lowest Health Survivor.血最少
//				9	= Highest Health Survivor.最多
//				10	= Survivor being Pummelled by Charger.被牛控
//				11	= Survivor mounted on a Mini Gun.机枪
//				12	= Survivor reviving someone.救人
//				13	= Survivor furthest ahead in flow distance (requires Left4DHooks plugin).跑图

//				20  = Survivor being attacked by a Witch (requires Actions extension: https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=336374).
//
// pinned:		Ignore attacking target when they're pinned by: 1=Smoker. 2=Hunter. 4=Jockey. 8=Charger. 15=All. Add numbers together.

// voms:		0=Off. 1=Allow attacking vomited Special Infected (order number 6).
// voms2:		0=Ignore attacking if target is currently covered in bile. 1=Allow attacking vomited incapacitated Survivors.

// dist:		How close the Special Infected must be to a target to prevent changing target.
